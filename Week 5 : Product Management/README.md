# Week 5 : Product Management

Imagine you are the Head of Product for a startup (You can decide the product, industry, or relevant Idea of interest to you) and you are leading a team to develop a new product geared towards external users, create a user story clearly outlining the following:

User stories serve a number of key benefits:

- **Stories keep the focus on the user**: It defines the task needed to provide an end product solution to a user.
- **Stories enable collaboration**: As the Head of Product (Assuming this role for this project) you will use a user story to define the goal of a new feature, the intended solution or path a user needs to take to complete a task on your website or product and ensure that your team can work together to best meet that goal. 
- **Stories drive creative solutions**: Stories encourage the team to think critically and creatively about how to best solve for an end goal.
- **Validation**: Upon successfully completing a user story task, your work is validated by the experience of the end user which creates better synergy within your team.

User stories are often expressed in a simple sentence, structured as follows:  **“As a [persona], I [want to], [so that].”**

Breaking this down: 

- "As a [persona]": Who are we building this for? We’re not just after a job title, we’re after the persona of the person. Max. Our team should have a shared understanding of who Max is. We’ve hopefully interviewed plenty of Max’s. We understand how that person works, how they think and what they feel. We have empathy for Max.
- “Wants to”: Here we’re describing their intent — not the features they use. What is it they’re actually trying to achieve? This statement should be implementation free — if you’re describing any part of the UI and not what the user goal is you're missing the point.
- “So that”: how does their immediate desire to do something that fit into their bigger picture? What’s the overall benefit they’re trying to achieve? What is the big problem that needs solving?


Considering the following when writing user stories:

- **Problem**: What new product are you trying to create and what problem does this solve for the end-user?
- **Outline subtasks or tasks**: Decide which specific steps need to be completed and who is responsible for each of them.
- **User personas**: For Whom?  Define who they are and build a persona for the end-user.
- **Ordered Steps**: Write a story for each step in a larger process.
- **Listen to feedback**: Talk to your users and capture the problem or need in their words. Do not guess your user story if you can talk to the end-user.
- **Time**: If your story takes more than one sprint to complete, identify an estimated timeframe needed to complete the project by breaking down your story into smaller sprints.
- **End**: The story is generally completed when the user can complete the outlined task. You need to define that point and clearly outline the task a user must do to meet this requirement.
