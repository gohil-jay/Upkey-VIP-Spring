# Week 3 : Marketing

The focus of this week will be geared towards creating a marketing audit and a marketing campaign with the lens of storytelling through video. As the world becomes more globalized and digitized, we face a pressing need to connect with each other instantaneously, and at scale. This unprecedented global connectivity has created a gap in how we appreciate, interact and understand the world around us through the content we consume daily. We spend an enormous amount of time consuming content socially through different media—social media, video, ads, news, and more.

Criteria: To successfully execute your presentation project, you should focus on the following:
- Message Clarity: Focused and targeted message.
- Delivery Elements: Effective use of both verbal and vocal elements (e.g., speaking volume, variety, and enunciation).
- Structure: Logically organized – opening, body, and closing are previewed and maintained. The audience’s needs are kept in mind.
- Content Clarity: Clear and consistent message that appropriately explains your complex topic.
- Visual Aids: Well-designed and delivered in an effective way using PowerPoint.

For this project, you will need to create a 60-second video, that clearly communicates the value of Upkey to a user.You can use any Upkey video from your recording library, Upkey’s social media, or a new video with any direction you choose to pursue.

The video must:
- Clearly communicate what Upkey is about and the value proposition to a user
- Communicate Upkeys value proposition to a specific audience
- Highlight the experience of a user from Upkey
- Communicate the value a user gets from engaging with Upkey
- Communicate how Upkey is different from its competitors

Note: You have the creative flexibility to think outside the box and take this project in any direction within the confines of the five points listed above.
