# Week 6 : Personal Portfolio

This week's goal is to create a portfolio that showcases the work and skills you have gained over the last 5 weeks.

**ULTIMATE GOAL of Portfolio**: Be creative as you can to meet your goals - also feel free to use any software or technology to support your portfolio.

A portfolio should be something a student can take to job or college interviews. It serves as documentation of achievements and will be helpful to the student when filling out college and job applications in the years to come. Remember that your portfolio needs to be neat and to the point.

Furthermore, in the lieu of this, I created a website based personal portfolio that can be accessed here : <a href="http://jaygohil-upkey.epizy.com/" target="_blank">JAY GOHIL's Upkey Jurney</a>.
