# Upkey-VIP-Spring
Upkey’s Virtual Internship Program (VIP) is a global experiential learning program focusing on an introduction to managerial functions of leadership, finance, marketing, and entrepreneurship. This repository contains my work on projects that I completed as a part of being an Upkey VIP Intern.

# Week 1 : Communication and Career Launch

Create a 5-min PowerPoint Presentation (4-7 PowerPoint slides) that clearly introduces, explains, and concludes a representation of your SMART plan for the next 1 year. Based on the lessons learned during this week, you are required to ensure that you clearly communicate your goals, strategies to achieve those goals, and how you’d like Upkey to play a role in helping you achieve your goals. Based on the PowerPoint concepts attached in the resources for this week you will ensure that you clearly communicate your goals to your group.

The SMART roadmap should be detailed enough that your group clearly understands it without your presentation. The PowerPoints should be clear, easy to understand and include charts and graphs to the extent they are helpful to explain your point. You will share your presentation and present it on Zoom. Make sure you are prepared to do both by Friday!

Criteria: To successfully execute this project, you should focus on the following:
- Message Clarity: Focused and targeted message.
- Delivery Elements: Effective use of both verbal and vocal elements (e.g., speaking volume, variety, and enunciation).
- Structure: Logically organized – opening, body, and closing are previewed and maintained. The audience’s needs are kept in mind.
- Content Clarity: Clear and consistent message that appropriately explains your complex topic.
- Visual Aids: Well-designed and delivered in an effective way using PowerPoint.

Benefits of this project:
- Recognize accomplishments: You will be able to assess the benefits of the Upkey VIP programs towards your career development and advancement.
- Guide progress: You will measure, identify the skill and opportunity development you need to achieve those goals, and work to ensure that your progress has a defined destination.
- Identify any problems: You will be able to assess the issues you face in achieving specific relevant goals and work to find solutions to those problems within or outside the Upkey community.
- And discuss career advancement opportunities with your mentors, network, and Upkey speakers.

How to use a Smart Goal:
- A smart goal can be an essential document to send when you pitch someone to become a mentor.
- A smart goal/plan will help you remain focused when working towards launching your career.
- A smart goal can be sent to a recruiter or your advisor to understand how diligent and focused you are towards obtaining your desired career goals.
