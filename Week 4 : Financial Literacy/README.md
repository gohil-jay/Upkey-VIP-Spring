Prepare and present your long-term wealth plan using a  presentation, where the plan can be within either 1 year, 5 years or 10 years. The mind map is divided 
into 6 categories, each category is listed below with an explanation and instruction. Here is some advice. The more work you put into researching each topic accurately, the more successful you will be in achieving your long-term goals. We invite you to get as creative as possible.

- **Financial Goal Savings** - After you’ve created a strong smart goal around your own financial goal, Fill in the Financial Goal Savings bubble with the amount your need saved and by when. 
For your presentation, feel free to add an image with the amount. Get as creative as you’d like.

- **Emergency Savings** - The average family household needs at least 6 months saved in expenses in case of  an emergency. Check in with your family, or if you live alone, calculate how much expenses you have as a family and fill in the bubble with how much money you need emergency savings as well as a timeline of when you would like to achieve this goal. For your presentation, feel free to add an image, amount, maybe even method you’ll use to achieve this goal.

- **Retirement Savings** - Dream big here. How much would you like to have saved up when you retire? Write that number in the bubble and how you plan on attaining this vision. Feel free to include methods such as, 401k, Roth IRA or any other kind of savings vehicles you wish to include in your presentation.
