# Upkey-VIP-Spring
Upkey’s Virtual Internship Program (VIP) is a global experiential learning program focusing on an introduction to managerial functions of leadership, finance, marketing, and entrepreneurship. This repository contains my work on projects that I completed as a part of being an Upkey VIP Intern.

# Week 1 : Communication and Career Launch

Create a 5-min PowerPoint Presentation (4-7 PowerPoint slides) that clearly introduces, explains, and concludes a representation of your SMART plan for the next 1 year. Based on the lessons learned during this week, you are required to ensure that you clearly communicate your goals, strategies to achieve those goals, and how you’d like Upkey to play a role in helping you achieve your goals. Based on the PowerPoint concepts attached in the resources for this week you will ensure that you clearly communicate your goals to your group.

The SMART roadmap should be detailed enough that your group clearly understands it without your presentation. The PowerPoints should be clear, easy to understand and include charts and graphs to the extent they are helpful to explain your point. You will share your presentation and present it on Zoom. Make sure you are prepared to do both by Friday!

Criteria: To successfully execute this project, you should focus on the following:
- Message Clarity: Focused and targeted message.
- Delivery Elements: Effective use of both verbal and vocal elements (e.g., speaking volume, variety, and enunciation).
- Structure: Logically organized – opening, body, and closing are previewed and maintained. The audience’s needs are kept in mind.
- Content Clarity: Clear and consistent message that appropriately explains your complex topic.
- Visual Aids: Well-designed and delivered in an effective way using PowerPoint.

Benefits of this project:
- Recognize accomplishments: You will be able to assess the benefits of the Upkey VIP programs towards your career development and advancement.
- Guide progress: You will measure, identify the skill and opportunity development you need to achieve those goals, and work to ensure that your progress has a defined destination.
- Identify any problems: You will be able to assess the issues you face in achieving specific relevant goals and work to find solutions to those problems within or outside the Upkey community.
- And discuss career advancement opportunities with your mentors, network, and Upkey speakers.

How to use a Smart Goal:
- A smart goal can be an essential document to send when you pitch someone to become a mentor.
- A smart goal/plan will help you remain focused when working towards launching your career.
- A smart goal can be sent to a recruiter or your advisor to understand how diligent and focused you are towards obtaining your desired career goals.

# Week 3 : Marketing

The focus of this week will be geared towards creating a marketing audit and a marketing campaign with the lens of storytelling through video. As the world becomes more globalized and digitized, we face a pressing need to connect with each other instantaneously, and at scale. This unprecedented global connectivity has created a gap in how we appreciate, interact and understand the world around us through the content we consume daily. We spend an enormous amount of time consuming content socially through different media—social media, video, ads, news, and more.

Criteria: To successfully execute your presentation project, you should focus on the following:
- Message Clarity: Focused and targeted message.
- Delivery Elements: Effective use of both verbal and vocal elements (e.g., speaking volume, variety, and enunciation).
- Structure: Logically organized – opening, body, and closing are previewed and maintained. The audience’s needs are kept in mind.
- Content Clarity: Clear and consistent message that appropriately explains your complex topic.
- Visual Aids: Well-designed and delivered in an effective way using PowerPoint.

For this project, you will need to create a 60-second video, that clearly communicates the value of Upkey to a user.You can use any Upkey video from your recording library, Upkey’s social media, or a new video with any direction you choose to pursue.

The video must:
- Clearly communicate what Upkey is about and the value proposition to a user
- Communicate Upkeys value proposition to a specific audience
- Highlight the experience of a user from Upkey
- Communicate the value a user gets from engaging with Upkey
- Communicate how Upkey is different from its competitors

Note: You have the creative flexibility to think outside the box and take this project in any direction within the confines of the five points listed above.

# Week 4 : Financial Literacy

Prepare and present your long-term wealth plan using a  presentation, where the plan can be within either 1 year, 5 years or 10 years. The mind map is divided 
into 6 categories, each category is listed below with an explanation and instruction. Here is some advice. The more work you put into researching each topic accurately, the more successful you will be in achieving your long-term goals. We invite you to get as creative as possible.

- **Financial Goal Savings** - After you’ve created a strong smart goal around your own financial goal, Fill in the Financial Goal Savings bubble with the amount your need saved and by when. 
For your presentation, feel free to add an image with the amount. Get as creative as you’d like.

Check in with your family, or if you live alone, calculate how much expenses you have as a family and fill in the bubble with how much money you need emergency savings as well as a timeline of when you would like to achieve this goal. For your presentation, feel free to add an image, amount, maybe even method you’ll use to achieve this goal.

Feel free to include methods such as, 401k, Roth IRA or any other kind of savings vehicles you wish to include in your presentation.
